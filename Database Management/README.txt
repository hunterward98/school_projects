This folder contains a final project that was worked on for the majority
of the semester. Everything we learned in this class was used in this
project, so I think it's perfect to include it.

MainAppFrame.java and Queries.java are used to create a
database management program with a GUI. MainAppFrame.java
is the whole GUI, which then utilizes Queries.java to
read/write to a SQL database. Unfortunately, the program immediately
crashes if it cannot establish a connection, and I have not
fixed it.

This program is a basic inventory management program, meant
for a small-scale business. Users can view basics statistics
that are generated with queries, view all product information
in a table view, add/remove products to the database, and
track orders. There is also an option to manually add an
order.

Anyways, this was a project that was worked on for most of the semester
for a database management class. Over the course of about ten weeks,
we created what would eventually become this application. It began
with creating a proposal, a basic schema, then as we learned about
relationships we had to adjust our schema. We also created an ER
diagram and a SQL file to implement our schema on the server provided
by the University, but also did some other things such as do small example
queries to show it works and do a rough sketch of our UI.

We were given a choice on how we wanted to do our UI, so we opted for a
GUI that uses Java. The largest reason for this was I had no experience with
Java or creating a GUI, and it was definitely going to keep it
interesting compared to a console UI. This certainly proved to be
challenging, and I'm sure that there are some things that I did that
may be unconventional or just straight up weird to someone else.
This also allowed for me to work with Eclispe IDE for the first time.

implement.sql is a file we had submitted that built upon a previous
project update. It creates all the tables for our data base, has
example queries, and populates some tables.
