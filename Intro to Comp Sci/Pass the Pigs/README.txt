This was one of the first "real" assignments in our introductory course.
This is the point where I started having fun programming and solving
the problems encountered. Seeing the results in the console on a

simple program. The game logic is in Main.cpp, function implementations
are in PA6.cpp, and just a general overview of the assignment is in PA6.h
