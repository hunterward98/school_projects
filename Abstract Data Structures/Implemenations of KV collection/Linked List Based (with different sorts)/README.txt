This assignment is a mixture of two assignments. The first assignment was
to build the linked list collection class, without any sorts. Then, we were
assigned to program insertion, quick, and merge sorts for the linked list
collection, benchmark them, and discuss the results. The bulk of the
work is contained in linked_list_collection.h. The rest of the files are
there for testing. Unfortunately, I have lost the .cpp file that was used
to implement testing for this assignment.
