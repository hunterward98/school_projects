This assignment is a mixture of two assignments. The first assignment was
to build the linked list collection class, without any sorts. Then, we were
assigned to program insertion, quick, and merge sorts for the linked list
collection, benchmark them, and discuss the results. I don't have everything
to run all the tests quite yet, particularly the sorting benchmarks. Will
update later!
