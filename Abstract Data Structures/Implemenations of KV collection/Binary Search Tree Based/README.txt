This is an implementation of a Binary Search Tree. This assignment was compiled
by using CMake on the command line. The commands to compile are:
	cmake CMakeLists.txt
	make
And to run unit tests or performance tests,
	./bst_tests
	./bst_perf randxxk.txt (where xx is 10, 20, 30, 40, or 50)

This tree has no balancing feature.
