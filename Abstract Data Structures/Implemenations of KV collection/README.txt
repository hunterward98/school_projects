Each of these assignments were performed in CPSC 223 at Gonzaga University.
CPSC223 is the third computer science class for most students and focuses
on Abstract Data Structures and Algorithms. Each of these assignments has
a testing suite, data inputs, and are based off the abstract collection class.

I did not intend for these to be ran, but for you to just look at. If you
wish to run them, read my intructions below.

Some of these assignments built off each other. For example, we did a
Linked List implementation before adding the different sorting alogrithms,
and we did a vector implementation before adding binary search. Because of this,
I decided to add the end product.

All of these were compiled using CMake. The appropriate CMake files are
included, but in general, you need the following files if you need to
compile these yourself:
			The files in CMakeLists.txt
			collection.h
			testdriver.h (if doing performance testing, this was provided by instructor)
			And the header file with the implementation itself.
			These have the convention <implementation>_collection.h
