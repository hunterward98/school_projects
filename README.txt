You've found my school work! This is simply a repository where I show off
assignments that I've worked on in school that I feel are worthy to post.
Some of these assignments have been built off each other, so I have tried
to combine them. Once I have gone on Christmas break, I will start adding
to some assignments and ensure they can be easily run by anyone. I aim to
do this by having different versions of the code - one as I developed it
the way I did it for school, and then as a Visual Studio project. However,
as this repository stands now, I have just been uploading files once the
assignments are finished, and intend to come back and polish everything
once I don't have to worry about homework :)

Most of these assignments were developed using gedit in a virtual machine
the school provides, based on lUbuntu. It already comes with CMake and
GTest installed for us, so we are able to compile from the command line and
test our programs fairly easily. However, we did not do testing until our
third computer science course, so only those assignments have tests.
Each one will come with a separate README with information on how it works, how it
was compiled, and other relevant information. Any assignment that was developed a
different way will be put in a folder titled accordingly. I have opted to
develop this way over other methods because it is how our professors grade
our assignments.

I hope this provides you a general idea of what I am capable of, as that
is the whole point of this repository! I do not intend for others to try
and run my code, but if you are attempting to run my code and are running 
into issues, please let me know. I would be more than willing to try and help.
I will be including everything you need to compile and run. These are all done
certain ways because of the way the department does their grading, so I develop
on the same platform to avoid any issues with new language issues.

I don't want to throw my email out publicly, as I only intend for those
trying to hire me to look at this, so please refer to my resume to contact me
if you have any questions about any programs I have posted.
Thanks!
