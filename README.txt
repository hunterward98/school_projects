You've found my school work! This is simply a repository where I show off
assignments that I've worked on in school that I feel are worthy to post.
Some of these assignments I have added on to after the fact, and I have
tried to keep their implementation as close to the original as possible.

Most of these assignments were developed using gedit in a virtual machine
the school provides, based on lUbuntu. It already comes with CMake and
GTest installed for us, so we are able to compile from the command line and
test our programs fairly easily. However, we did not do testing until our
third computer science course.
Each one will come with a separate README with information on how it works, how it
was compiled, and other relevant information. Any assignment that was developed a
different way will be put in a folder titled accordingly. For example, any programs in
Assembly will be put in the folder titled Assembly, and will have a README providing
information on all programs and how they were constructed, tested, and ran.

I hope this provides you a general idea of what I am capable of, as that
is the whole point of this repository! I do not intend for others to try
and run my code, but if you are attempting to run my code and are running 
into issues, please let me know. I would be more than willing to try and help.
I don't want to throw my email out publicly, as I only intend for those
trying to hire me to look at this, so please refer to my resume to contact me.
Thanks!
