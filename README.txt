You've found my school work! This is simply a small repository where I show 
off assignments that I've worked on in school that I thoroughly enjoyed and
feel like they can highlight my capability - there's no point in having every
assignment I've ever done in here!

Some of these assignments have been built off each other, so I have tried
to combine them. Some of these programs may not work because they utilized
servers provided to me by Gonzaga University, but I no longer have access
since I am a graduate. Therefore, some of the applications will likely not
work if you try and run them. Furthmore, some of these programs utilize
a microcontroller and/or external circuit. Truthfully, this repo is a small
collection of assignments I enjoyed working on and have proudly stayed up
til the late night working on them - sometimes for multiple nights in a row.
Unfortunately, a lot of my work from Junior year is gone because I worked on
the lab computers a lot that year and put them on the network drive at
Gonzaga, but I no longer have access to it and never got a chance to
retrieve it because COVID kicked in that year and the University was
essentially locked down until I graduated.

These assignments will span across all four years at my time at Gonzaga.
You'll see one of my first assignments, battleship! You'll also run into
one of my latest, a file system for a real-time OS. I want to show my
progress, but also all the experience I've gained strictly through University.
Anyways, I've split this directory into the title of the classes that I
took throughout my time at GU that I enjoyed. Because of the aforementioned issue about
not getting most of my work from the University network drive, my projects
from Operating Systems, Parallel Computing, and Embedded Systems are
gone forever :( Fortunately, everything I learned from those classes is
utilized in Real-time Operating Systems, even constructing circuits.

I hope this provides you a general idea of what I am capable of, as that
is the whole point of this repository! I do not intend for others to try
and run my code, but if you are attempting to run my code and are running 
into issues, please let me know. I would be more than willing to try and help.
Some assignments were graded based on the external result (this is the case for
any program that used a microcontroller), so you won't be able to run them in 
the same way that I did. And as I initially stated, some of these programs may 
not work or be modified because I no longer have access to resources that made
these programs work.

I don't want to throw my email out publicly, as I only intend for those
trying to hire me to look at this, so please refer to my resume to contact me
if you have any questions about any programs I have posted.
Thanks!
