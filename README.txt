You've found my school work! This is simply a repository where I show off
assignments that I've worked on in school that I feel are worthy to post.
Some of these assignments have been built off each other, so I have tried
to combine them. Some of these programs may not work because they utilized
servers provided to me by Gonzaga University, but I no longer have access
since I am a graduate. Therefore, some of the applications will likely not
work if you try and run them. Furthmore, some of these programs utilize
a microcontroller and/or external circuit. These programs were developed
using Keil uVision, which was used to upload the program to the board.

These assignments will span across all four years at my time at Gonzaga.
You'll see one of my first assignments, battleship! You'll also run into
one of my latest, a file system for a real-time OS. I want to show my
progress, but also all the experience I've gained strictly through University.

I hope this provides you a general idea of what I am capable of, as that
is the whole point of this repository! I do not intend for others to try
and run my code, but if you are attempting to run my code and are running 
into issues, please let me know. I would be more than willing to try and help.
I will be including everything you need to compile and run. Some assignments
were graded based on the external result (this is the case for any program
that used a microcontroller), so you won't be able to run them in the same
way that I did. And as I initially stated, some of these programs may not
work or be modified because I no longer have access to resources that made
these programs work.

I don't want to throw my email out publicly, as I only intend for those
trying to hire me to look at this, so please refer to my resume to contact me
if you have any questions about any programs I have posted.
Thanks!
