You've found my school work! This is simply a small repository where I show 
off projects that I've worked on in school that I thoroughly enjoyed and
feel like they can highlight my capability - there's no point in having every
project I've ever done if one of them can encapsulate multiple.

Some projects built off each other and have been combined, while others
may be entirely broken because they depended solely on connecting to
the University servers, which I can no longer access. Other projects
may have used external circuits on connecting to a microcontroller,
so it may be a little difficult to see them completely functional.
These are mostly just projects I enjoyed the most in school and reflect
my abilities and knowledge, and I am also immensely proud of the late
nights I spent working on them. However, just because I've mostly worked in
C or C++ doesn't mean I'm not willing to learn new languages! My favorite
project by far was the database project where I used Java for the
first time.

These projects will span across all four years at my time at Gonzaga.
You'll see one of my first projects, battleship! You'll also run into
one of my latest, a file system for a real-time OS. I want to show my
progress, but also all the experience I've gained strictly through University.
Anyways, I've split this directory into the title of the classes that I
took throughout my time at GU that I enjoyed.

I hope this provides you a general idea of what I am capable of, as that
is the whole point of this repository! Please contact me if you
have any questions.
